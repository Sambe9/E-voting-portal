Introducing "E-Voting Portal," a dynamic and innovative project designed to revolutionize the process of electing class representatives in our College. With a focus on inclusivity, transparency, and student engagement, ClassVoice provides a user-friendly platform that empowers every student to actively participate in the democratic selection of their class representative.

Gone are the traditional methods of paper ballots and lengthy speeches; ClassVoice leverages cutting-edge technology to streamline the entire election process. Students can easily access the platform through their devices, cast their votes securely, and stay informed about the candidates' platforms and visions for positive change within the class.

Our project ensures that every student's voice is heard, promoting a sense of unity and shared responsibility within the class community. Through ClassVoice, we aim to foster a culture of active participation, encouraging students to take an active role in shaping their academic environment.
